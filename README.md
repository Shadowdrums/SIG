# Unix/Linux Signal (SIG) Reference

This document provides an overview of the signals (SIGs) available in Unix-like operating systems. Signals are used for inter-process communication, allowing processes to be notified of various events.

## List of Common Signals

### 1. SIGHUP (1)
- **Description:** Hang up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process.
- **Usage:** Often used to reload configuration files without stopping the process.
  
### 2. SIGINT (2)
- **Description:** Interrupt from the keyboard (typically triggered by `Ctrl+C`).
- **Usage:** Used to stop a process from running.

### 3. SIGQUIT (3)
- **Description:** Quit from keyboard (typically triggered by `Ctrl+\\`).
- **Usage:** Causes the process to terminate and produce a core dump.

### 4. SIGILL (4)
- **Description:** Illegal Instruction.
- **Usage:** Indicates that an illegal, invalid, or undefined machine instruction was encountered.

### 5. SIGABRT (6)
- **Description:** Abort signal from abort function.
- **Usage:** Usually generated by the process itself when it calls the `abort()` function.

### 6. SIGFPE (8)
- **Description:** Floating-point exception.
- **Usage:** Generated by a floating-point arithmetic operation, such as division by zero.

### 7. SIGKILL (9)
- **Description:** Kill signal.
- **Usage:** Immediately terminates the process. This signal cannot be caught or ignored.

### 8. SIGSEGV (11)
- **Description:** Invalid memory reference (segmentation fault).
- **Usage:** Indicates an access to a memory location that the process was not allowed to access.

### 9. SIGPIPE (13)
- **Description:** Broken pipe: write to a pipe with no readers.
- **Usage:** Sent to a process when it attempts to write to a pipe that has been closed on the other end.

### 10. SIGALRM (14)
- **Description:** Timer signal from `alarm()` function.
- **Usage:** Used to notify a process that a timer has expired.

### 11. SIGTERM (15)
- **Description:** Termination signal.
- **Usage:** Requests the process to terminate gracefully. This signal can be caught, allowing the process to perform cleanup before exiting.

### 12. SIGUSR1 (10) and SIGUSR2 (12)
- **Description:** User-defined signals.
- **Usage:** Reserved for user-defined purposes in applications.

### 13. SIGCHLD (17)
- **Description:** Child process has stopped or terminated.
- **Usage:** Sent to a parent process when a child process stops or terminates.

### 14. SIGCONT (18)
- **Description:** Continue if stopped.
- **Usage:** Used to resume a process that has been stopped by `SIGSTOP` or `SIGTSTP`.

### 15. SIGSTOP (19)
- **Description:** Stop process.
- **Usage:** Stops (pauses) the process execution. This signal cannot be caught or ignored.

### 16. SIGTSTP (20)
- **Description:** Stop typed at terminal (typically triggered by `Ctrl+Z`).
- **Usage:** Suspends the process temporarily, similar to `SIGSTOP`, but can be resumed with `SIGCONT`.

### 17. SIGTTIN (21)
- **Description:** Background process attempting read.
- **Usage:** Sent to a process that attempts to read input from the terminal while in the background.

### 18. SIGTTOU (22)
- **Description:** Background process attempting write.
- **Usage:** Sent to a process that attempts to write output to the terminal while in the background.

## How to Use Signals in Your Application

You can handle signals in your application using signal handlers. Here is a simple example in C:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void handle_sigint(int sig) {
    printf("Caught signal %d\n", sig);
    exit(1);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint);
    while (1) {
        printf("Running...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
